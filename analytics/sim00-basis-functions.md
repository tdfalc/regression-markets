# Simulation 00 - Basis Functions

## 1. Description
Playing around with different basis functions `psi(x)` applied to a one-dimensional input `x`, including polynomials of different degrees, trigonometric functions, sigmoids, and more. Now I just need to generalize the regression market mechanism to faciliate arbratiary sets of basis functions, as opposed to simply polynomial regression.

## 2. Results
